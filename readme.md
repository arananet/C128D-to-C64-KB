This tiny adapter allows to plug your C64 keyboard on a C128D computer.

# Notes

This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Do you use long cables with this adapter, MAX 1M long.
